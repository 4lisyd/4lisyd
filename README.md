Humans are capable of doing great things.

The human brain is vastly more powerful than even the best GPU in many aspects, though direct comparisons are difficult because they operate in fundamentally different ways. Here are some key points:
1. Computational Power (FLOPS)

    The human brain is estimated to perform at least 10¹⁵ (1 petaflop) to 10¹⁸ (1 exaflop) operations per second.
    The best GPUs today, like the NVIDIA H100, can reach around 60 petaflops (tensor operations) in AI workloads.
    The brain is potentially 10x to 1000x more powerful in terms of raw processing.

2. Energy Efficiency

    The brain consumes only 20 watts of power.
    The H100 GPU consumes 300-700 watts.
    The brain is at least 10-100 times more energy efficient than GPUs.

3. Storage Capacity

    The brain’s memory capacity is estimated between 1 to 1000 terabytes.
    A high-end GPU has 80GB of VRAM.
    The brain far exceeds GPUs in storage capacity.

4. Adaptability & Learning

    The brain can self-repair, learn, and adapt dynamically.
    GPUs require explicit programming and structured data.

Therefore, NEVER GIVE UP!
